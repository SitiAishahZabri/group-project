            <h2>Hi, welcome to Glossier!</h2>
            <p>We make products designed with your real beauty routine in mind. Here you will find skincare, makeup, body care, and fragrance, all painstakingly perfected to be worthy of your bathroom shelf.</p>
            <p>Glossier, Inc. was founded in 2014 on the belief that beauty is nott built in a boardroomâ€”it happens when you are a part of the process. We got our start with Into The Gloss, a beauty website devoted to people sharing the products they love, and our source for inspiration and information.</p>
            <p>Now, we are building the future beauty company where everything we make starts with you. We create the products you tell us you wish existed. We believe in thoughtful design, and enabling conversation (which is where it all starts). But most of all, we believe that beauty is about having fun, wherever you are in your journey.</p>
            <p>It is nice to meet you! Now that you're here, take a look around. Meet our products, see them in action, and let us know what you think.</p>
